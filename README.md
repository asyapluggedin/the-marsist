# the-marsist

The Marsist is a hypothetical magazine for the first colonies of the red planet. 

The title ‘Marsist’ is simultaneously an homage to the word ‘Marxist’ and ‘Resist’, semantically building a text-based media space that allows the citizens of Mars to interrogate their social organization to finally break the human hive mind viruses and escape the invisible traps we are attempting to escape on Mars.


I thought of this project ~2 hours before an interview with the JPL Ops Lab, and threw together the website splash page and print mockup in that time.
